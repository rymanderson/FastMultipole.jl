# Matrix Operator Refactor Index

## START HERE

This file is the only required first-read coordination document for Matrix
Operator Refactor work.

Routine task protocol:

1. Read this `START_HERE.md` first.
2. Select the first row, in table order, whose dependencies are complete and
   clear-context approved. If a phase explicitly declares parallel lanes,
   select the first eligible row within any lane; table order does not
   serialize independent lanes.
3. Open only the selected task file.
4. Do not read sibling task files.
5. Do not read `../MATRIX_OPERATOR_REFACTOR.md` unless the selected task
   explicitly requires it or the selected task is a Milestone Review.
6. For clear-context approval, read only this `START_HERE.md`, the completed task
   file, the artifacts or production files listed by that task, and the
   verification notes. Focus on the following in order of importance:
   1) consistent with the stated objectives; 2) correctness; 3) performance; 4) robustness (of code and tests); 5) minimally invasive approach; 6) human-readable. If you can think of any significant way to improve any of these, ask my permission and do it. Don't worry about small improvements. If you must change anything, another agent will need to do the clear-context approval.

No separate active-task pointer file should be added. The first unblocked row
in the index—or the first unblocked row in each explicitly declared parallel
lane—is the active task selection mechanism.

## Source Of Truth

Current user instructions are the first source of truth in all cases.
This index is the second source of truth for task order, status, blockers, Milestone
Reviews, and the hard phase gate. Task files may contain task-local
requirements only; they must not redefine global policy.

If this index, a task file, and `../MATRIX_OPERATOR_REFACTOR.md` disagree
during a Milestone Review, the review must stop and require a
coordination-document fix before further task work continues.

Clear-context approval must be performed by a different agent after the task is
finished. The completing agent must not approve its own work.

## Hard Phase Gate

All Theory Phase rows, including Theory Milestone Reviews and the Theory
Addendum rows `008d`, `008e`, `008f`, `008g`, and `008h`, must be marked both
`Done` and `Approved` before any Implementation Phase row starts.

Theory work may create or edit artifacts under:

- `MATRIX_OPERATOR_REFACTOR/theory/`
- `MATRIX_OPERATOR_REFACTOR/scripts/`
- `MATRIX_OPERATOR_REFACTOR/data/`

Theory work must not modify production FastMultipole code under `src/`.

For each concept, derivation precedes script, script precedes generated data,
and all related Theory artifacts precede approval. Implementation may touch
`src/` only after the full Theory gate is approved.

After the Theory gate is approved, `008b-implementation-replan.md` and
`008c-implementation-performance-baseline.md` must both be completed and
approved before task `009` or any later Implementation task starts.

## Theory Phase Acceptance Target

By the end of the Theory Phase, the approved artifacts must specify matrix
operators for both the compressed complex solid harmonic basis and the real
solid harmonic basis. For each basis, the theory must cover M2M, M2L, and L2L
operations using invariant matrices and z-axis rotations only; all non-z
rotation effects must be expressed through approved invariant axis-swap
matrices and fixed operator compositions.

Before task `008a` can approve the Theory gate, the Theory artifacts must also
include an example for a point mass of unit strength that:

1. obtains the source expansion;
2. applies M2M, M2L, and L2L through the approved matrix-operator chain;
3. evaluates the resulting expansion at a target point; and
4. demonstrates convergence to the analytic potential `1/r` as expansion order
   increases.

## Milestone Reviews

Milestone Reviews are blocking tasks. No later normal task may start until the
preceding Milestone Review is complete and approved.

Each Milestone Review requires the reviewing agent to:

1. Read all of `../MATRIX_OPERATOR_REFACTOR.md`.
2. Read this `START_HERE.md`.
3. Inspect completed task files and their listed artifacts since the previous
   milestone.
4. Confirm work still matches the background design, hard phase gate, and task
   ordering.
5. Try to find ways to improve contributions to the main goal of speeding up the
   FMM with GPU.
   Make notes to implement if you find them.
6. Record review notes in the Milestone Review task file and mark the row
   `Done`.
7. Get clear-context approval before downstream tasks continue.

## Theory Addendum

These Theory tasks were added by the `008b` Implementation Re-Plan after the
`008a` Theory milestone (and expanded by the `2026-06-13` re-plan addendum
recorded in `008b`, which added `008f`). They are full Theory Phase rows: each
requires clear-context approval, and—like every other Theory row—each blocks
every Implementation task under the Hard Phase Gate. They become unblocked once
`008b` is complete and approved.

The `008f` row is listed before `008d` because `008d` depends on it; the
f-before-d ordering is intentional and dependency-driven.

The `008g` row was added later by user request on `2026-06-13`. It derives the
radix-path interaction-list construction and depends on `008d` (the stencil) and
`008f` (the cell geometry), so it cannot be selected until `008d` is complete and
approved.

The `008h` row was added by user request on `2026-06-15`. It derives the
Lamb-Helmholtz channel accuracy-order relationship (the hypothesis that the `χ`
channel must be carried at `P + 1` while `φ` stays at `P`). It depends on the
Lamb-Helmholtz operator form (`003`), the constant-`P` stencil (`008d`), and the
real-basis kernel derivatives (`008e`); it is independent of `008g` and is listed
last.

| Done | Approved | Task | Summary | Blocking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [x] | [x] | `008f-theory-radix-sort-clustering.md` | Derive a radix-sort (Morton/Z-order) clustering for large-`N`/GPU producing uniform-grid cells for translation-invariant M2L stencils. | `008b`, `007` |
| [x] | [x] | `008d-theory-dynamic-p-error-m2l-integration.md` | Specify constant-`P` error handling: legacy octree keeps dynamic-`P`; the radix-sort path moves error control into a conservative translation-invariant interaction-list stencil. | `008b`, `008f`, `002`, `005`, `007` |
| [x] | [x] | `008e-theory-real-basis-kernel-derivatives.md` | Derive real-basis evaluation of potential, gradient, and gradient Jacobian (Hessian) for the `1/r` kernel. | `008b`, `007`, `008` |
| [x] | [x] | `008g-theory-radix-interaction-list.md` | Derive the radix-path M2L interaction-list construction: apply the `008d` constant-`P` stencil over `008f` uniform-grid cells, batch M2L by integer offset class, and route the near/self complement to direct. Verify complete, non-double-counted n-body coverage on a test grid. | `008d`, `008f`, `008b`, `007`, `005` |
| [x] | [x] | `008h-theory-lamb-helmholtz-accuracy-order.md` | Derive the Lamb-Helmholtz channel accuracy-order rule (hypothesis: `χ` carried at `P + 1` while `φ` stays at `P`), with stencil/buffer/operator-sizing consequences and a convergence-slope verification. | `003`, `005`, `008d`, `008e`, `007`, `008b` |

## Implementation Re-Plan Gate

These required planning and benchmark tasks are not Implementation tasks. They
must be completed and approved after the Theory gate is approved and before any
production code work starts.

| Done | Approved | Task | Summary | Blocking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [x] | [x] | `008b-implementation-replan.md` | User-in-the-loop Implementation re-plan after Theory is approved and before production code work begins. | All Theory rows, `008a` |
| [x] | [x] | `008c-implementation-performance-baseline.md` | Pre-implementation performance, allocation/storage baseline, and design gate before production code work begins. | All Theory rows, `008a`, `008b` |

## Implementation Code Placement

Implementation tasks that touch production `src/` must follow these placement
rules:

1. New struct and type definitions go in `src/containers.jl` alongside the
   existing core data structures. Do not create standalone type files.
2. New translation operators go in a new file named after the closest existing
   source file with `_batched` inserted before `.jl` (for example
   `translate.jl` -> `translate_batched.jl`, `rotate.jl` -> `rotate_batched.jl`).
3. New radix-path driver code (uniform-grid clustering, Morton sort, constant-`P`
   stencil, and the radix interaction list) goes in `tree_batched.jl` and
   `interaction_list_batched.jl`, following the same `_batched` naming rule.
4. GPU code must live behind a package extension or runtime flag in a
   `*_cuda.jl` file (for example `translate_batched_cuda.jl`) so the CPU path and
   the existing public API are unaffected when CUDA is absent.

## Implementation Phase

Every Theory Phase row above, including the Theory Addendum rows `008d`,
`008e`, `008f`, `008g`, and `008h`, is a blocker for every row in this section. Do
not start any Implementation task until all Theory rows are marked both `Done` and
`Approved`. Do not start any Implementation task until
`008b-implementation-replan.md` and
`008c-implementation-performance-baseline.md` are also marked both `Done` and
`Approved`.

Implementation task files must list relevant approved Theory dependencies by
filename. This does not narrow the gate: every Theory task and every preceding
Milestone Review blocks every Implementation task.

The `2026-06-18` roadmap review (recorded in
`MATRIX_OPERATOR_REFACTOR/roadmap-review-2026-06-18.md`) added rows `013a`, `020`,
`021`, `022`, `019b`, and `023`, and sharpened the summaries of several existing
rows. The additions close three confirmed scope gaps: the radix-path driver that the
new operators run on (`020`, `021`), a GPU implementation home for the `008c`
device-residency target (`022`), and the production-integration row that turns the
validated operators into realized end-user speedup (`023`). Row `019b` stages the
small-`P`/tiny-batch fallback and the padded-vs-ragged `chi` layout as an exploratory
benchmark plus a required user-discussion decision before implementation.

The `2026-06-19` M2L operator roadmap update recognizes two near-term M2L
strategies and elects to build and benchmark **both**. `013` (done) supplies the
materialized arbitrary y-rotation building blocks: cached invariant `H(pi/2)` /
`S_pos` / `S_neg` data, `build_Ts_from_S!`, and production-parity wrappers that
apply a reconstructed `Ts(theta)`. `013b` supplies the fixed `90 degree`
y-axis swap primitives (`R_y(+pi/2)` / `R_y(-pi/2)`) only; `013c` (done, `2026-06-23`)
then realizes the explicit factored `Z_phi -> S -> Z_theta -> S_inv` alignment and
return alignment in the `T_n(theta) = S_n Z_n(theta) S_n^{-1}` form, preserving
FastMultipole's sign and extra-`pi` convention. **Roadmap amendment (user-directed
`2026-06-23`, "Plain-H"):** a spike proved the literal chain — composing `013b`'s
ζ-dressed `T_y_pos90/neg90` through the production y kernel with a `Z_theta` — is
structurally incapable of reproducing `R_y(theta)` (`(ζS)Z(ζS⁻¹) ≠ ζ(SZS⁻¹)`; ζ does
not commute through the swap). The shipped `S`/`S_inv` are therefore the **plain** fixed
per-degree swap matrices `V_n`/`U_n` with ζ/η dressing absorbed: every angular Fourier
component of the production y-operator is rank 1, so `Y_n(theta) = U_n diag(e^{i nu
theta}) V_n` with fixed, batch-shared `U_n,V_n` and a cheap `e^{i nu theta}` middle —
`O(P^3)`/column, genuinely distinct from the materialized `013` path, and **not** the
ζ-dressed `013b` primitives (those remain only for the `013`/materialized parity
surface). See `013c` Revised Implementation Notes and `theory/axis-swap-conventions.md`.
The shared `011` z-axis M2L block and `012` Lamb-Helmholtz coupling are
applied by `014`'s composition, not by `013b`/`013c`. The folded no-`Ts` y-rotation
path is not a product or benchmark variant; it may appear only as temporary debug
scaffolding while validating explicit stages. `014` composes swappable
`MaterializedYRotationM2L` and `FactoredRotationM2L` interfaces over shared `011`
z-axis M2L blocks, `012` Lamb-Helmholtz coupling, common cache/scratch conventions,
and common production-parity tests. `015` compares only those two near-term
variants; at that stage fully dense per-offset M2L, partially folded hybrids
around `K_z`, alternate z-translation cache/scaling policies, and real-basis
execution were deferred options for later implementation/performance tasks.
Rows `023c` through `023f` now take up the precomputed-y and fully dense options;
`024` is the definitive four-strategy single-/multi-threaded CPU and GPU
end-to-end comparison after integration, fed into the `019a` final review.

Row `024a` was added by user request on `2026-07-14`: after `024`'s definitive
data exists, plot the accumulated benchmark evidence (crossovers, speedups,
stage breakdowns, storage, accuracy/cost tradeoffs) as human-readable figures
that communicate the project's successes and limitations and support tradeoff
decisions; `019a` cites those figures and therefore blocks on `024a`.

Row `024b` was added by user request on `2026-07-25`: measure end-user speedup
versus particle count at literature `P=4` (`expansion_order=3`), comparing the
legacy octree on 64 CPU threads and the resident H200 lifecycle (Float64
primary, Float32 extra) against legacy single-thread CPU. CPU MAC is fixed at
0.5 and leaf size is manually searched per case to step-5 resolution. The GPU
uses an independently reviewed, ell-scaled analytic stencil that matches the
legacy equal-cell discrete cutoff; every row records sampled-direct error.
Its scaling/accuracy figure extends the `024a` set as fig09, and `019a`
therefore also blocks on `024b`.

Rows `025`, `026`, and `027` were added by user direction on `2026-07-28`, after
the `024b` clear-context review found the radix far field is **single-level**:
`build_radix_routes!` stamps a constant `route_levels = ell` and routes both
endpoints through `leaf_to_node`, so every M2L is leaf-to-leaf, `M2M`/`L2L` run
but feed nothing, and M2L cost is `O(C^2)` in occupied cells. With direct cost
`~|near|*n*(n/C)` the optimum is `C ~ n^(2/3)` and the total is `O(n^(4/3))`;
the measured GPU exponent is `1.46`. That, not allocation sizing, is why `024b`'s
`n=1e6` point regressed to `94x` and why eight `ell=6/7` cases were
unconstructible — the route reservation is tight to within 4% of actual, so no
lazy-allocation change can help. `025` derives a rigid, source-major,
phase-indexed, level-invariant stencil (the `024b` `epsilon ∝ 2^ell` scaling
fixes one lattice cutoff at every depth, which is what makes it level-invariant)
plus an exact-once coverage proof and the level-scaling law that lets one
operator table serve all levels; `026` implements it on the host resident
lifecycle with windowed generation so the full pair list is never compiled; `027`
mirrors it on CUDA. The stencil is parameterized by a single near radius, so the
same construction yields both the `024b` `theta=0.5` stencil (`|o|^2 <= 12`;
179/1253) and the classic FMM stencil (`|o|^2 <= 3`, exactly `|o|_inf <= 1`;
27/189), and `026`/`027` measure the two against each other and against the
shipped flat path. The flat `ConstantPAnalyticStencil` is retained as a
selectable oracle and stays the default until measurement justifies switching —
it is genuinely cheaper below the hierarchical crossover (`C ~ 1430` occupied
cells at `theta=0.5`). `025` is a scoped derivation row confined to `theory/`,
`scripts/`, and `data/` artifacts and is listed in the Implementation Phase
table: it does **not** reopen the Theory Phase hard gate and does not re-block
any completed Implementation row.

Row `028` was added by user request on `2026-07-28`, staged after the planned
`025`–`027` interaction-list improvements. It is a rigorous feasibility study
for solving 1,000,000 particles in at most 0.01 seconds, on a single H200 at
literature `P=4` (`expansion_order=3`) with the `024b` sampled-direct error
methodology; Float32 qualifies for the verdict when its sampled error is
within the `P=4` Float64 truncation error (user decision `2026-07-28`). The
verdict timing boundary is the **per-time-step cost**: one full resident
evaluation plus everything a real step repeats — device-side convection
update and tree/route refresh — with no per-step body H2D/D2H; steady-state
evaluation-only and including-transfers boundaries are also measured and
reported but do not decide the verdict. The study must consolidate
the existing benchmark record and run targeted new benchmarks where evidence
is missing; produce an end-to-end and per-stage time breakdown; determine
whether each important stage is compute-bound, memory-bandwidth-bound,
transfer-bound, launch/latency-bound, or otherwise constrained; measure host
to device and device to host transfer costs separately from resident compute;
and assess whether particle state must remain permanently on the GPU across
convection and other time-stepping operations. Because the `024` strategy
defaults were measured under the flat leaf-only list, the study must evaluate
a per-level heterogeneous M2L strategy mix on the hierarchical path (e.g.
factored/concatenated at sparse coarse levels, fused dense at the leaf level)
using the per-level occupancy data from `026`/`027`. The study must identify
whether one algorithm stage bottlenecks the solve or time is broadly
distributed, quantify the remaining gap and uncertainty at all three
boundaries, and give evidence-backed, prioritized recommendations (with
expected gains and risks) for reaching the target; the optimization list
requires user approval before implementation begins. This
row must then implement the approved optimizations, verify
correctness and accuracy, and repeat the end-to-end and per-stage measurements.
Improving the production path toward the 0.01-second target—not merely
describing the gap—is a primary outcome. Continue the measured
profile/optimize/retest cycle until the target is reached or the remaining
barriers and next steps are rigorously quantified, with a user checkpoint at
the end of every cycle.

Rows `023a` and `023b` were added by user direction on `2026-07-15`, after `024`
planning found its premise stale: the `022`/`023` resident lifecycle shipped only
the materialized-lineage whole-slab dense strategies (`SharedRotationM2L`,
`ConcatenatedFixedZM2L`); `options.operator` is inert in the production
lifecycle (it affects only the retained flat-oracle test launchers and a
`DEBUG[]` assertion), and the CUDA path throws on `FactoredRotationM2L`. The
`024` end-to-end A/B is therefore unrealizable until a genuine factored resident
M2L exists. `023a` builds the host stage (per-degree batch-shared `U_n`/`V_n`
mode-matrix GEMMs applied per offset class — equivalently the grouped-GEMM M2L
lever deferred by `019`/`023` for `019a`), and `023b` mirrors it on the CUDA
device-resident lifecycle; `024` blocks on both.

Rows `023c` through `023f` extend that resident M2L comparison with two more
production strategies, split into host and CUDA stages. `023c`/`023d` precompute
the per-angle, per-degree matrices `M_n(theta) = U_n D_n(theta) V_n` while
leaving azimuth rotation, z translation, Lamb-Helmholtz coupling, and scatter
separate. `023e`/`023f` complete the existing `DenseTranslationM2L` placeholder
as one full coefficient-space matrix `S(Delta r)` per displacement class. Every
row `023a` through `023f` requires functional parity first and then a measured
profile/optimize/retest phase; host tasks require single- and multi-thread BLAS
data from a non-macOS host, and CUDA tasks require H200 before/after data. Task
`024` compares all four resident strategies and may select different defaults by
platform, expansion order, and batch/class-occupancy regime. The traditional
per-column reconstructed `Ts(theta)` path remains a correctness oracle, not a
resident performance candidate.

Row `030` was added by user request on `2026-08-03`, after the `019a` final
review was approved. It measures the per-time-step verdict-boundary cost
versus `n` (`1e3`–`1e6`, the `024b` grid) at the `028` shipped-default GPU
settings, as three fixed-depth series `ell = 3/4/5` (user decision: fixed
`ell` across the sweep, not per-`n` best; the bracket was revised from
`4/5/6` to `3/4/5` on `2026-08-03` before any sweep case ran, because the
optimal depth tracks `n` downward — `028` measured `ell = 4` best at
`n = 2e5` and `024b` chose `ell = 2/3` below `n = 1e5`) in both the
FP16-WMMA/Float32
winner configuration and Float64, and then recommends a per-`n` optimization
(including retuning the level-radius geometry to a per-`n` accuracy target —
the "fixed error" lever) with estimated savings, modeled from the per-stage
data and validated by spot-check H200 runs at 2–3 representative `n`.
Completing `030` does not reopen `019a`; its results are recorded as an
addendum note in `019a`, mirroring the `029` convention. `030` does not
depend on the deferred `029` and does not resume it.

## Integration Phase

This phase was added by user request on `2026-08-04`, after the `019a` final
roadmap Milestone Review was approved. Now that the matrix operators deliver
decent GPU speedups, the goal is to streamline the API so external codes can
connect easily. FastMultipole provides a **generalizable** device-resident
system interface; `../FLOWVPM.jl` (branch `gpu-full`) is optimized as its first
consumer, and updating FLOWVPM to run its FMM velocity/Jacobian solve on the
GPU as fast as possible is the main objective of the phase.

Design intent: a consumer's particle states are stored and maintained on the
GPU so no per-step host/device body transfer is required. Alternatively, if
transfers prove cheap for a given consumer, this phase publishes measured
guidelines for the transfer-based coupling instead. Memory allocation
procedures are key: there must be no per-timestep reallocation when a maximum
particle count is known a priori — the `RadixFMMCache` capacity contract
(`max_n_bodies` plus derived capacities, zero per-step allocation) is the
existing mechanism, and this phase generalizes and documents it rather than
reinventing it. The storage layout of positions, strengths, extra states (such
as the smoothing radius for finite-core models), potential, gradient, and
hessian is a first-class design topic. The hessian is stored as **9
components** (user decision `2026-08-04`): the 6-component symmetric option is
skipped because the velocity gradient contributed by the Lamb-Helmholtz /
vector-potential channel is not symmetric in general, and FLOWVPM requires
Lamb-Helmholtz.

Repository policy (user decision `2026-08-04`): FLOWVPM edits are committed on
the `gpu-full` branch of `../FLOWVPM.jl`; FastMultipole edits are committed in
this repository. All task files and coordination stay in
`MATRIX_OPERATOR_REFACTOR/` and reference `../FLOWVPM.jl` paths. **Any agent
working on FLOWVPM must read `../FLOWVPM.jl/CLAUDE.md` in full before touching
that repository.** FLOWVPM public API changes (exported names, keyword
defaults) can break the downstream consumers FLOWUnsteady and VortexLattice —
the CPU path and public surface must be preserved.

Benchmark ground rules: the baselines are single-thread and 64-thread CPU runs
of FLOWVPM **at the `gpu-full` branch-point commit `e2bd487`** (2026-05-16,
v4.0.4), profiled to show what costs what and where the bottlenecks lie, so the
phase ends with clear documentation of every speedup achieved relative to those
baselines. Two test cases are used throughout: (a) a random vortex particle
field in a unit cube with average smoothing radius chosen to give an overlap
factor of 2; (b) a **helical wake cylinder** — a solid cylinder of length
5 diameters, particles uniform in its volume at overlap 2, strengths tangent to
a helix of pitch `p = D` with tip-weighted magnitude `|Γ| ∝ r` (user direction
`2026-08-05`, replacing the vortex ring; rationale and full definition in
`033`'s wake amendment). The ring was abandoned because it is locally thin
(near sets half-empty, breaking the `031a` §6 occupancy model) and has no single
overlap factor (`σ/rl = 3` radially, `≈1.58` azimuthally); the wake is locally
dense and isotropic with one `β`, while keeping the coherent aligned strengths
the cube lacks. The wake still fills only 3.14% of its bounding cube, which is
retained deliberately as representative of real wakes and staged as a
production lever in `035`. The accuracy gate is a
**fixed tolerance: sampled relative gradient (velocity) RMS error ≤ 1e-3**
against the direct references (user decision `2026-08-05`, superseding the
`2026-08-04` "match FLOWVPM default FMM parameter accuracy" gate — no
default-settings accuracy check is required anymore; the sampled-direct
references remain as the measurement instrument). The tolerance gates GPU
winners and speedup eligibility; fixed historical CPU rows remain visible
with their measured errors even when they fail. Parameters are tuned
separately per case for optimal performance; the wake case is
additionally benchmarked at the unit-cube-optimal parameters. CPU
baseline runs go on cluster CPU nodes, never the local machine.

Standing directive: **if significant speedup levers are identified during this
phase, invest in them** — row `035` is the measured tuning and optimization
campaign, with a user checkpoint gating each production optimization cycle.
Only levers expected to improve end-to-end U/J-solve time by at least 5% enter
that campaign.

Gating uses explicit parallel lanes; table order does not serialize them:

- interface: `031 -> 032`;
- nearfield: `031 -> 031a`, then `031a + 032 -> 032a`;
- CPU baseline: `033`, independent after `019a`;
- consumer integration: `032 + 033 -> 034`, which may run in parallel with
  `032a`;
- performance join: `030 + 032a + 034 -> 035`;
- milestone review: every Integration row above -> `036`.

This phase does not reopen the Theory or Implementation gates.

The fixed phase accuracy gate applies to sampled relative gradient (velocity)
RMS error only: `U <= 1e-3`. Every reported configuration must also log the
sampled Jacobian `J` RMS error as a diagnostic, but `J` does not select or
disqualify a winner. Historical `033` CPU timings remain in the record even
when they miss the velocity gate; a speedup ratio or headline may use only a
baseline configuration that passes it. No additional tuned CPU baseline is
required.

**Amendment (user direction `2026-08-05`, revised after numerical review):**
the resident vortex nearfield gets two candidate strategies. (i)
*Regularized-everywhere*: evaluate the regularized Biot-Savart kernel for
every direct-nearfield pair, borrowing FLOWVPM's GPU polynomial erf
(`custom_erf`, an FDLIBM rational port) and fused U+J math. (Superseded in
part by the `032` task-file amendment and settled by measurement `2026-08-05`:
the shipped `g`/`h` evaluation is erf-free — theory §3 series + §6.2 one-`exp`
outer form — after the mandated H200 A/B measured it 1.5x faster than the
`custom_erf` port at equal delivered accuracy; the fused U+J math is borrowed
as stated, and no FDLIBM code ships in `src/`.) (ii)
*Partitioned replacement*: keep the singular FMM far field; ensure the direct
geometry contains every pair inside the conservative smoothing cutoff
`r/σ_src ≤ ρ_t`; evaluate those pairs once with cancellation-safe
regularized U/J formulas and use the cheaper singular kernel for remaining
direct pairs. Row `031a` derives the cutoff, stable small-`ρ` series, and
exact-once geometry contract; row `032a` implements it and selects the default
by H200 measurement. (iii) *Two-pass additive correction* (added by user
direction `2026-08-05` during the `031`/`031a` clear-context review): leave the
FMM entirely unmodified and add a second pass carrying only the regularization
deficit over the cutoff shell. It touches no `025` routing invariant, but its
subtraction lands in the accumulator across two kernels, so it requires either
Float64 accumulation of the singular direct term and its correction, or the
`ρ_c = 2` hybrid; `031a` §6.1 derives it, bounds the conditioning, and shows
that two-pass and partitioning have opposite depth trends. An earlier
singular-minus-correction proposal had been removed as ill-conditioned as
`ρ → 0`; the derivation now quantifies that failure as a Float32 tail effect
and supplies the two remedies. **Kernel scope (user decision `2026-08-05`): only the FLOWVPM
default `gaussianerf` kernel is supported in this phase** — it is the sole
kernel compatible with the `CoreSpreading` viscous model
(`_kernel_compatibility`), so nothing viscous-capable is lost; `winckelmans`
support is dropped. (The `033` ring case was first redefined to `gaussianerf`
before its large cases ran — job 13051516 partial ring data discarded — and the
ring was then retired entirely later the same day in favour of the wake
cylinder; the replacement case is `gaussianerf` throughout.) The
SFS (`ζ`/`Estr`) kernel derivation is deferred to a later, not-yet-staged
row.

## Adaptive Octree Phase

This phase was staged by user direction on `2026-08-06`, following the
sparsity-suitability review of that date. The review found the radix path is
occupancy-compacted (compute scales with occupied cells) but rigidly uniform
— one global leaf width, one cubic box, one depth `ell`, no leaf-population
bound — so it serves uniformly sparse fields well but multi-scale density
(dense clusters plus diffuse regions; wake rollup; `CoreSpreading`-grown σ)
poorly: the global `σ_max` geometry gate forces a globally shallow tree, and
an unbounded fat cell serializes `O(K²)` nearfield work in a single warp and
B2M in a single thread. The remedy is a **2:1-balanced adaptive Morton
octree** in the PVFMM/ExaFMM-T style: with 2:1 balance, same-level (V-list)
M2L remains a finite translation-invariant offset-class set, so the `025`
level-scaling law, the per-`(level, offset)` class batching, and the
existing resident M2L strategies and operator tables carry over unchanged;
the new pieces are the adaptive near-field lists (U direct, W/X via M2T/S2L)
and device tree construction from the sort/scan/compact primitives already
in the CUDA path.

The whole phase is gated behind `035`, `036`, and `037`. By user direction
(`2026-08-13`) the three nearfield-reduction rows `037a`/`037b`/`037c` are
staged BEFORE the adaptive-octree derivation: they appear first in the table
below, so the first-unblocked-row rule activates them ahead of `038`. `037c`
is conditional — it opens only if `037b`'s recorded verdict recommends it
(and the user agrees); otherwise it is closed by pointer and `038` follows
`037b` directly. `037b`'s rotor-wake case also supplies (or refutes) the
multi-scale-density evidence `038`'s entry gate asks for. The `038`
theory row carries an explicit evidence-or-waiver entry gate: multi-scale
density must be measured as a binding cost (or the user must waive that
requirement) before derivation begins. `038` is a scoped derivation row
(`theory/`, `scripts/`, `data/` only) and does not reopen the Theory Phase
hard gate or re-block any completed row. Row `041a` (user-directed
`2026-08-06`) is the phase's reporting row: publishable figures comparing
old (uniform grid) and new (adaptive) machinery on uniform and non-uniform
fields in time and memory, at matched stated accuracy, following the
standing TikZ/CSV figure conventions and extending the `024a` set.

Row `037d` was added by user request on `2026-08-14`, after `037b` falsified
two-pass deficit splitting and recommended `037c` NO-GO. It is a cheap,
paper-only cost/error estimate of evaluating the full `gaussianerf`-regularized
U/J field by particle-mesh (spread/FFT/interpolate — no direct pass, no
kernel split), with the Ewald-split variant as a secondary comparison. It
exists to decide for ~zero hardware cost whether a Fourier-space nearfield
replacement is worth staging as an implementation row; it does not gate `038`
and changes no production code.

Rows `037e` and `037f` were added by user request on `2026-08-14`, after the
`037b` approval, from the nearfield-lever discussion of that date (the
symmetric/Newton-3 pair lever was considered and dropped). Both are
constant-factor levers on the shipped partitioned nearfield, independent of
(and parallel to) the structural `038` lever: `037e` prunes the partitioned
direct list toward the exact `rho_t`-ball geometry (the mechanism `037a`
validated on the two-pass correction list — 56–65% candidate elimination,
bit-identical errors — pointed at the path we actually ship); `037f` cheapens
the regularized pair kernel itself under the lenient 1e-3 gate. Both are
off-by-default until measurement passes the promotion gate, and any default
change requires explicit user approval. They do not gate `038` or each other,
but they are implemented as one coordinated effort because they touch
adjacent nearfield surfaces.

Row `041b` was added by user direction on `2026-08-15`. It closes two
nearfield questions with the cheapest evidence first: whether reducing the
U/J output surface can materially reduce complete solve cost while preserving
all FLOWVPM consumers (including SFS), and whether strategic-target sampling
plus interpolation can economically replace any remaining direct work. It is
a measurement/theory row only. The existing `035`, `037d`--`037f`, and `041`
records supply its A0 and Stage-0 inputs; a production implementation is
permitted only as a separately reviewed successor if the registered rank,
accuracy, and complete-solve gates pass.

Row `041c` was added by user direction on `2026-08-15` from the `041b`
strategic-target discussion. It tests a more analytic alternative: treat each
current terminal U-list pair as a multilevel refinement queue, peel newly
admissible source/target subpairs into M2L/M2T/S2L shells at successively finer
levels, and leave only the irreducible nearest-neighbor complement to direct
P2P. This is not a second adaptive-tree implementation and must state its
increment over `038`--`041`: it refines *inside the residual terminal U-list*,
including virtual subleaves or target filtering where useful. The first row is
proof/census only; production work requires a separately reviewed successor.

Row `041d` was added by user direction on `2026-08-17` from the `041c` NO-GO
discussion. It closes or funds the remaining smooth-representation nearfield
alternatives: (1) a registered census pre-kill of regularized-basis P2M/M2P
substitution of residual direct pairs (the "regularized solid harmonics"
proposal), reusing the `041c` machinery and calibration — the `041b` rank
probe does not bound this regime because it ran at `sigma/h ~ 1e-3` where
regularization is inert; and (2) a paper cost estimate of a sigma-adaptive
multilevel smooth representation (AMR-VIC / multilevel summation) for the
sigma-heterogeneous rotor regime that `037d`'s global-mesh verdict could not
serve. Theory/measurement row only; it does not gate `042`, and any
successor (derivation or implementation) requires separate user staging.

Row `041e` was staged by user direction on `2026-08-17` to attempt the most
promising remaining direct-kernel redesign: replace independent warp-per-U-edge
execution with a target-owned fused traversal of each target leaf's complete
U-neighbor adjacency. The hypothesis is reuse and work-shape improvement, not
the already-falsified atomic-only lever. It preserves the shipped kernel and
exact U list and is off by default through measurement.

Row `041f` was staged by user direction on `2026-08-17` to resolve 041d's one
remaining open nearfield architecture: replace the placeholder
cost band for sigma-adaptive AMR-VIC / multilevel summation with an actual
level/patch/halo census on the deterministic rotor snapshot, a complete
Gaussian level-decomposition and U/J error budget, exact-once ownership, and
a bounded AMR-FFT-versus-MSM optimizer. It is theory/measurement only;
production work requires a separately staged successor. A
`2026-08-17` review amendment (recorded in the task file, binding) adds the
uniform-sigma unified-solver verdict (does the adaptive mesh subsume the
funded 037d global VIC, so a future successor stages one mesh implementation,
not two)
and a mandatory priced FMM-retained banded-hybrid configuration (keep the
shipped singular far field and U/V routing; mesh only the sigma-affected
bands).

Row `041g` was staged by user direction on `2026-08-17`. It closes the one
untested harmonic gap left by `041c`: the shipped sigma demotion is
whole-pair, and `041c` barred M2L on demoted lineages while measuring the
rotor's whole-leaf pure-singular ceiling at 58.7–62.7% — on proxies, never on
the actual rotor sigma field. `041g` derives a predictive singular-M2L
admissibility criterion from the kernel-difference (regularization-tail)
bound already in 031a §4 plus the constant-P truncation bound, generalizes it
via dimensionless collapse variables (leaf width in sigma units
`K^{1/3}/beta`, neighborhood-local sigma spread; validated against a
registered parametric sweep over overlap, spread, and sigma correlation
length), and censuses sigma-class M2L re-admission (class-filtered
multipoles, predeclared logarithmic bins) on the actual rotor snapshot with
the existing calibration. Deliverable even on NO-GO: the admissibility map —
when singular M2L works for the regularized problem and when it cannot. On
gate pass it proposes the per-class demotion interaction list as a
separately staged successor. Theory/measurement only.

Row `041h` was staged by user direction on `2026-08-18`. It moves from
synthetic reconstructions to a REAL simulated rotor wake: the final-step
particle fields of the FLOWPanel `rotor_hover` simulations
(`../../FLOWPanel.jl/data/`, n = 67,745 primary / 37,165 secondary, with
mid-run steps for a true refresh/epoch-persistence measurement), and asks
what the full per-step cost can be driven to on ONE H200 using the whole
038–041e toolbox (adaptive octree, sticky demotion, per-n geometry tuning,
graph capture, 037f g/h, the 041e fused nearfield + selector). At this
n ≈ 4–7e4 scale the problem is latency/refresh-floor-dominated, not
throughput-dominated; the row must also deliver a modeled (not implemented)
8-H200 estimate grounded in the 029 floors, including the break-even n.
Production tuning changes are opt-in and individually user-gated (035
convention).

Rows `041i` and `041j` were staged by user direction on `2026-08-18`, from
the sigma-contamination discussion of that date. The user hypothesized that
large-particle sigma contaminates the multipole representation (expansions
approximate singular `1/r`, not the regularized kernel actually evaluated),
inflating the direct list and under-utilizing expansions. The session's
evidence review found the hypothesis contradicted for the rotor (`041g`
zero sigma demotions; 58.7–62.7% of rotor direct pairs purely geometric;
leaf-local sigma spread ~1.01; adaptive nearfield only ~10% of lifecycle)
but identified two unmeasured channels: the `041g` census ran at `q=12`,
not the shipped `near_radius2=5`/`rho_t=4.789` operating point (a 2.24x
tighter margin where rotor `ell=7` leaves would demote), and the sigma
split-veto/depth-cap channel (`src/tree_batched.jl:802-813`) was never
censused. `041i` closes both cheaply. `041j` benchmarks a
kernel-independent FMM (PVFMM, the strongest maintained open-source KIFMM;
no maintained GPU KIFMM exists) as an external CPU baseline: it documents
the work required to host the regularized `gaussianerf` kernel (all KIFMMs
use the same singular-far/regularized-P2P split we ship), empirically tests
the user's regularized-check-surface accuracy hypothesis against the 031a
basis-independent bound, and delivers a written per-stage GPU-limitations
prediction. `041j` does not gate `042` (external-comparison row, `037d`
convention). Neither row is started; `041h` remains the first unblocked
implementation row.

Row `041k` was staged by user direction on `2026-08-20`: measure how far
sheer hardware power carries a naive O(N²) direct evaluation on a single
H200 — N from `1e2` by half-decades until median wall time exceeds 10 s —
for the realistic FLOWVPM workload (regularized `gaussianerf` U/J, and
U/J plus SFS via the `041b` §1.2 factorized identity), in F64 and F32 with
established levers (`rsqrt`, shared-memory tiling). Direct evaluation
carries no polynomial/multipole approximation (exact up to rounding), so
the row also anchors the brute-force/FMM crossover and builds the first
fused direct+SFS kernel in the stack (today `sfs=true` is a hard error on
the GPU path), pricing SFS enablement with data. Standalone benchmark row
(`scripts/`, `data/` only); does not gate `042`.

**042 scope override (user direction `2026-08-20`).** The adaptive milestone
review covers only `038`–`041a`. Rows `041b`–`041j` neither gate nor belong to
that review; `041k` is independently reviewed and also does not gate it. This
override supersedes the earlier staging notes that placed some of those rows
before `042`.

Row `042a` was added by user direction on `2026-08-20` from the `042`
milestone's highest-value GPU follow-on. It optimizes the adaptive X-list S2L
execution shape—target-major grouping, source/target reuse, reduced atomic
retirement, and a bounded `P=4` specialization—without changing the tree,
interaction list, operator mathematics, or accuracy budget. Same-job H200
stage and complete-step gates decide promotion; it must finish and be approved
before the partitioned multi-GPU phase derives against the final single-GPU
lifecycle.

H200 evidence gates any default change. **Done `2026-08-13`:** centered rectangular is only 0.3-1.2% faster; accuracy requires P6 for the tested two-pass geometry. Exact AABB pruning removes 56-65% of correction candidates and cuts the `n=1e6` two-pass solve 12.9%, but it remains 4.6% slower there and 39% slower at `n=1e5`; no default change or further uniform-grid cycle. | `037` |

Builds the checksummed realistic rotor-wake case (e.g. DJI 9443 via `~/…/FLOWPanel.jl`), extends the 3C error-decomposition oracle to the two-pass field, and produces an exact per-approach speedup report (same-job anchors, critical-path pricing). Renders the go/no-go verdict for `037c` and the multi-scale-density evidence for `038`. Default changes need explicit user approval. | `037a` |
| [x] | [x] | `037c-impl-mesh-deficit-fourier-nearfield.md` | **Closed by pointer (user direction `2026-08-14`): `037b` measured NO-GO — no compact-support regime at the 1e-3 gate (cutoff floor 3.2–3.7σ) and a meshed pass bounded at ≤18 ms vs a ≥28 ms shortfall; no campaign run; `038` follows `037b` directly; the no-split Fourier question moved to `037d`.** Original scope: conditional on the `037b` verdict + user go. PME-style mesh evaluation of the smooth Gaussian deficit: theory-first spectral/interpolation error model, then device-resident spread/convolve/interpolate (rectangular mesh; FFT vs local stencil by measurement) under the capacity/zero-allocation/counter contracts, benchmarked against BOTH the shipped baseline and the `037b` winner so each approach's exact speedup is reported separately. Off-by-default; default changes need explicit user approval. | `037b` |
| [x] | [x] | `037d-theory-fourier-nearfield-cost-model.md` | Paper-only cost/error estimate of full particle-mesh (VIC-style) evaluation of the `gaussianerf`-regularized U/J field — spread/FFT/interpolate on the rectangular bounds, no direct pass — priced against the `037b` same-job anchors (cube/wake/rotor, `n=1e5`/`1e6`) under the 1e-3 velocity gate; must model mesh resolution vs `sigma_min`, free-space padding, transform count for U+J, spread/interpolate cost and order, and σ-heterogeneity handling (σ-binned/multi-mesh), plus the Ewald-split variant as a secondary bound. Verdict: stage an implementation row or close the Fourier direction. `theory/`, `scripts/`, `data/` only; no hardware runs required. | `037b` |
| [x] | [x] | `037e-impl-nearfield-finebin-pruning.md` | Prune the shipped partitioned direct nearfield toward the exact `rho_t sigma` ball: fine-bin/sub-Morton candidate generation and/or exact source-directed AABB-gap predicates on the production direct list (the `037a`-validated mechanism, applied to the partitioned path), preserving exact-once coverage, capacity/zero-allocation, counters, and graph capture. Pre-registered H200 screen on cube/wake/rotor at `n=1e5`/`1e6`; promotion gate: velocity RMS ≤ 1e-3, ≥5% faster end-to-end on a material case, no >3% regression elsewhere; off-by-default until the gate passes and the user approves. | `037b` |
| [x] | [x] | `037f-impl-nearfield-pair-kernel-cheapening.md` | Cheapen the regularized `gaussianerf` U+J pair kernel under the 1e-3 gate: candidate mechanisms are reduced-order `g`/`h` polynomials, shared-memory/texture lookup+interpolation, and reduced-precision inner distance math with FP32 accumulation; select by measured A/B at equal delivered accuracy (the `032` methodology). Same promotion gate, contracts, and off-by-default rule as `037e`; `P=4` and both-precision tests required. **Done `2026-08-14`: `:fp32` passed the full gate (+7.4-7.8% wake, worst regression -2.5%, delivered-error deltas ~1e-8) and the user approved the default flip the same day — `CUDA_NEARFIELD_GH_MODE` now defaults to `:fp32` (no-op on Float32 configs; `:shipped` = control/opt-out); `:reduced`/`:reduced_fp32`/`:lut` ship opt-in with recorded ceilings.** | `037b` |
| [x] | [x] | `038-theory-adaptive-radix-octree.md` | Derive the 2:1-balanced adaptive Morton octree: construction as sort/scan/compact, U/V/W/X interaction lists with an exact-once coverage proof at both near radii, M2T/S2L operators with constant-`P`-consistent error bounds and Lamb-Helmholtz coverage, a per-cell σ geometry gate replacing the global `σ_max` form, cost/capacity model (incl. a synthetic multi-scale case), and the refresh/rebuild policy. V-list M2L must reuse the `025` level-scaled operator tables unchanged. Entry gate: `035`/`037` evidence that multi-scale density binds, or explicit user waiver. | `035`, `036`, `037` |

| [x] | [x] | `041a-benchmark-adaptive-vs-uniform-figures.md` | Publishable benchmark report and figures: old uniform grid vs new adaptive octree on uniform and non-uniform fields (cube, wake, multi-scale contrast sweep, σ-heterogeneous variant), time and memory, host and H200, every row at stated sampled-direct accuracy under the 1e-3 gate. Figures (TikZ/pgfplots + CSV, extending the `024a` set) must show the old approach's failure mechanism (fat-cell/forced-shallow costs, capacity memory) and the new approach's measured gains.

Prove exact-once coverage and use existing snapshots/timings for a route-only promotion model before any production code. **Done `2026-08-17`: NO-GO — ideal promotion exists on cube/multiscale, but virtual rectangles are below measured expansion-route crossovers; conservative selector falls back to direct everywhere.** | `025`, `037e`, `038`, `041`, `041b` |

## Production Integration Phase

Staged by user direction on `2026-08-20`, gated on `042` (approved
`2026-08-20`) and placed BEFORE the Multi-GPU Scaling Phase. Objective: use
this project's matrix-ops machinery to accelerate the FLOWPanel item-018
campaign (`../../FLOWPanel.jl/BRAINSTORM/INDEX.md`). The 023 profiling of an
018 production step (2026-08-20) found 170–230 s/step on 64 cores, per-step
cost ~linear in particle count, and **~75% of a production step spent in the
Dynamic-SFS estimator `Estr_fmm!` near-field walk** — the single largest
lever.

**Budget arithmetic.** The stated stretch target — 30 revolutions in under
1 hour — means 1080 steps in <1 h, i.e. **≤3.3 s/step average, a 52–70×
speedup over today**. The CPU body-pass floor alone (~36 s,
kerneloffset-radius-bound) breaks that budget, so reaching it requires
accelerating BOTH the particle side (GPU UJ+SFS — the 75% lever; `041k`
measured fused SFS at only +26–31% over a U/J pass) AND the panel passes
(a GPU panel kernel, or a drastically cheaper panel-pass configuration).
The user's fallback resource envelope — 1×GPU + 64 CPU threads — bounds
achievable time rather than guaranteeing the 1 h mark. **Escape hatch:** if
`052`'s measured wall time misses <1 h, its verdict may pull specific
Phase-Q levers (`054`/`055`) forward as an addendum rather than waiting for
the `053` milestone — the budget is tight enough that stranding the known
1.6–1.7× nearfield levers behind a phase boundary is not acceptable.

**Ordering rationale.** The branch merges (`046`) come FIRST so that all
subsequent GPU work (hardening, SFS, coupling) lands directly on the
branches FLOWPanel consumes — avoiding building on the tmp3 clone and then
pushing every diff through a 174-commit merge — and so the riskiest task is
retired first. `047` and `048` then run in parallel (both block only on
`046`).

**Conventions and checkpoints.** Production changes require explicit user
checkpoints (the `035` convention); FLOWVPM's CLAUDE.md constraints apply to
work on that repo. The consolidated user checkpoints for this phase: repo
layout after the merges (retire tmp3 vs re-point; in `046`), the residency
default (`049`), and any default-behavior change (`053` review). `041h`
stays in the Adaptive phase as its first unblocked row; this phase does not
duplicate it and cites its results as soft inputs, not gates.

| [x] | [x] | `046-impl-branch-unification.md` | **Done `2026-08-20`: both merges landed (`flowpanel-20260817` ← matrix-ops, only 2 conflicts; `flowpanel` ← gpu-full, 11 hunks + repo-wide dedicated-vorticity completion `bc9b9a6`); FastMultipole + FLOWVPM suites green; FLOWPanel 16/18 with both failures in the user's uncommitted WIP (radius_inflation), not merge-caused; 018 CPU smoke passed (116 clean steps); tmp3 retired per user direction (all branch tips + stash preserved as `tmp3/*` refs and a tag; see decisions log D2).** Original scope: the merges (user direction), front-loaded: fetch tmp3 FastMultipole `matrix-ops` into `projects/FastMultipole` and merge into **`flowpanel-20260817`** (176 commits vs 14; conflict hotspots: fmm!/tree internals vs FmmPlan/NearfieldInfluenceCache/autotune-perturb — the doc carries the complete 14-commit list); fetch tmp3 FLOWVPM `gpu-full` into `projects/FLOWVPM.jl` and merge into **`flowpanel`** (23 vs 10; flowpanel's `9fd25e6` Estr_fmm! source/target selection is load-bearing for 018). Safety protocol: tag/backup both sides of each merge, perform the merge on a scratch branch, and fast-forward the real branch only after the test gate passes. Gates: FastMultipole, FLOWVPM, FLOWPanel test suites green post-merge; the 018 driver still runs CPU-only unchanged (short smoke, not a campaign); user checkpoint on repo layout (retire tmp3 vs re-point). | `042` |
| [x] | [x] | `047-impl-production-settings-hardening.md` | **Approved `2026-08-21` after clear-context remediation review: all 31 tunables classified and production reads consolidated through `radix_setting`; construction-lock drift remains loud at device-step entry; atomic `set_radix_settings!` makes FLOWVPM grouped overrides all-or-nothing; tiled-thread validation is CUDA-shape exact; typed source/target tree, host/device nearfield, and radix-route policies replace production Boolean selection while compatibility shims remain. The earlier 046 entry-gate violation and D4's improper dispatch deferral are explicitly recorded and D4 is superseded. Focused host/static gates and FLOWVPM host suite green; no new HPC job.** Original scope: consolidate + robustify the GPU production surface (on the unified branch): the ~25 process-global `Ref` tunables get validated, documented behind one consolidated settings surface, and either made per-cache (`CUDARadixLifecycleOptions`/`AdaptiveTreePolicy`) or construction-time-locked with loud errors on late flips (today they silently keep the old mechanism, `translate_batched_cuda.jl:2247-2252`) — plus a regression test that a post-construction flag flip errors loudly; Future Dispatch Cleanup Notes items (`allow_host_bodies`, `nearfield_device::Bool`, `target::Bool` tree-role arg, route-selection flags → dispatch-on-object); generalization/robustness sweeps (F32/F64 × adaptive/uniform × P=4/P=8 parity — the P=4 test rule; capacity/out-of-box error paths; recenter contract); full FastMultipole suite green.

Job 13294119 completed P=4/P=8 × F32/F64 × rho_t=4.211/4.789: all CPU `Estr_direct!`/`Estr_fmm!` gates pass (F64 9.18e-5–4.09e-4 ≤5e-4; F32 9.20e-5–4.09e-4 ≤1e-3; mechanical parity ≤4.1e-7). It stopped only because obsolete `@test_broken` declarations treated passes as errors; now fixed.

Done `2026-08-21` (verdict: `theory/panel-multisystem-scoping.md`): option B' selected — keep FLOWPanel's 3-pass structure; cross passes become rectangular GPU brute-force kernels (wake→panels ~0.02-0.04 s at 041k rates; panels→particles ~0.4-2 s, retiring the 36-s floor); panel self-solve via device-resident dense NearfieldInfluenceCache matvec (10.8 GB fits H200; iterations = 051 measurement); radix framework untouched (A rejected: homogeneity excludes panel sources regardless of the targets===sources lift; unnecessary at these sizes); C priced as fallback ceiling ~60-80 s/step. The panel work is justified independently by the measured ~36 s CPU body-pass floor; the corrected 049 particle budget remains pending.** Original scope: decision row (user: "check if system-on-system looks significantly easier before doing it"). Options, priced with recorded facts: (A) lift the radix v1 `targets===sources` restriction (`translate_batched_resident.jl:1735-1743`; `target_bodies` aliased at `translate_batched_cuda.jl:5447`) to support distinct target sets incl. panel centers/probes; (B) individual system-on-system GPU evaluations mapped onto FLOWPanel's existing 3-pass structure (`FLOWPanel_simulate.jl:673-712`) — **a-priori favorite: least invasive, the CPU path already runs separate passes**; choose A only if B's measured pass overhead is material; (C) hybrid: particles on GPU, panel passes on 64-thread CPU (bounded by the ~36 s body-pass floor → cannot reach 30 rev/h; states what it CAN reach). Also scopes the panel GPU kernel itself (FLOWPanel `direct!` overload `FLOWPanel_abstractbody.jl:1260`; element types constant source/doublet tris + vortex rings/sheets/filaments) and where FmmPlan/NearfieldInfluenceCache fit.

Panel↔particle coupling via rect GPU seam (parity gates green); body solve repriced from 7.3 s FMM-path to 0.607 s via opt-in source-potential matrix S on `Backslash` (lossless: self pair is all-direct, bitwise == DirectBackend; the on-cluster exact-0 checks were vacuous — claim rests on the local nonzero-σ probe). Device gemv / Float32 S deferred to `052+`. Commits across all three repos in handoff eleventh-session-part-2.** Original scope: Implement the `050` verdict: panel↔particle GPU coupling (panel GPU direct kernel, or system-on-system passes, or hybrid), wired through FLOWPanel's `influence!`/`FastMultipoleBackend`. Fallback resource envelope per user: 1×GPU + 64 CPU threads.

## Peak Efficiency Phase

Staged by user direction on `2026-08-20`, after the Production Integration
Phase and still BEFORE the Multi-GPU Scaling Phase: implement as many small
optimizations as possible to bring the single-GPU code as near peak hardware
efficiency as possible before scaling out.

**Efficiency-gap analysis (2026-08-20 discussion).** The FMM's effective
efficiency sits **~10× below the brute-force kernel's measured 38%-of-peak**
(`041k`: 3.3e11 pairs/s FP32 FMA-bound with the opt levers). The losses live
in M2L scatter/gather, small memory-bound GEMMs, the ~50 µs/window launch
floors (`027`), the ~0.87 ms per-GPU control floor (`028`/`029`), and
refresh — **NOT in P2P**, which is already partitioned
singular/regularized + `037f` fp32 + `041e` target-owned CSR. The governing
cost model is T(K) ≈ αKN + βN/K + floors with the GPU optimum at K=256
(`027`): **every kernel cheapening must be followed by leaf-size retuning to
harvest** — cheapening α lets the autotuner raise K*. `028`'s finding that
leaf M2L is load-bound, not atomic-bound, directs the scatter/gather effort
to the load side.

Same-job A/B on the 018 operating point + standard cases; `037f`-style promotion gate (≥5% end-to-end on a material case, ≤3% regression elsewhere, 1e-3 accuracy, P=4 both precisions). `041k` measured ceilings recorded in the doc (3.3e11 pairs/s ≈ 38% FP32 FMA peak; 1.6–1.7× from these levers on all-pairs F32; F64 opt inert below n≈3e4). | `053` |

## Multi-GPU Scaling Phase

Staged by user direction on `2026-08-11` at the closure of `029`. The `029`
P2 prototype falsified mirrored-tree multi-GPU scaling structurally
(replicated refresh/upward/finalize bound the 2-GPU wall at ~3.8 ms ≈ 61%
efficiency even with zero communication) while validating the communication
mechanism itself (bitwise-lockstep work-list slicing + allreduce, 0.190 ms
comm+orch at n=1e6; `cuMemPoolSetAccess` pool P2P grant for 234 GB/s
NVLink). This phase pursues the successor: a **partitioned-tree
decomposition** — costed Morton-range ownership, local subtrees below a
split level with replicated+allreduced coarse levels, per-level multipole
halo exchange inside captured graphs, body halos for the boundary
nearfield, and ownership migration on occupancy epochs.

**Targets (user direction `2026-08-11`): `<= 1 ms` per resident step for the
fixed 1M-body literature-`P=4` workload on up to 8 H200s is the goal;
`<= 2 ms` still counts as a win.** The recorded feasibility bound: perfect
8-way compute splitting (~0.58 ms) plus the measured ~0.87 ms n-independent
per-GPU control floor plus ~0.2 ms comm lands at ~1.0–1.2 ms, so the 1 ms
goal additionally requires shaving the per-GPU launch floor. `029`'s
accuracy, recurring-cost, and independent-reproduction rules carry over
unchanged.

The phase is gated behind the Adaptive Octree Phase and its S2L optimization
follow-on (`042a`) by user direction ("after the adaptive tree and other
improvements"): the adaptive
octree changes tree construction, occupancy lookup, and list generation —
the very surfaces a partitioned tree must split — so partitioning is derived
once against the final tree machinery rather than twice.

Gate: 2-GPU efficiency `>= 75%` vs the then-current single-GPU record at unchanged accuracy. | `043` |
| [ ] | [ ] | `045-benchmark-multigpu-highscore.md` | Scale to 4/8 GPUs: scaling ladder, per-GPU launch-floor reduction as a measured lever if the `<= 1 ms` goal demands it, independent reproduction, final leaderboard and verdict (`<= 1 ms` goal / `<= 2 ms` win), results recorded as `019a`/`029` addendum notes. | `044` |

This phase does not reopen any earlier gate.

## Future Dispatch Cleanup Notes

For new GPU/device-path work, prefer dispatch on source, destination, and policy
objects over boolean residency flags. Item `022` should use destination-driven
output finalization: resident CUDA evaluation writes `state.output` on device, and
copy/writeback dispatch decides whether the destination is a host array, device
array, or device-native target system.

Cleanup disposition (047 remediation; compatibility shims remain for downstream callers):

- `allow_host_bodies` is absent; source residency dispatches through
  `HostResident` / `DeviceResident` and source-buffer traits.
- The legacy nearfield path accepts `HostNearfield` / `DeviceNearfield`.
- Production tree construction uses `SourceTree` / `TargetTree` roles.
- Production radix generation uses `RadixRouteSelection` policy objects.
